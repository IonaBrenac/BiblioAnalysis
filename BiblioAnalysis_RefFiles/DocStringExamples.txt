    ''' The `parsing_concatenate_deduplicate` function concatenates parsing files of two corpuses 
    using the `_get_common_files` and `_concatenate_dat` internal functions. 
    Then it proceeds with deduplication of article lines using the `_deduplicate_articles` internal function.
    Finally, it rationalizes the content of the other parsing files using the IDs of the droped articles lines
    in the `_deduplicate_dat` internal function.
    The outputs are the parsing files of the concatenated corpus and the deduplicated corpus saved in dedicated folders.
    Control files which names are set in the globals 'CONCATENATED_XLSX' and 'DEDUPLICATED_XLSX' are also saved 
    as EXCEL files in the same folders.
    
    Args:
        useful_path_list (list): list of paths of the folders where the corpuses are parsed.
        inst_filter_list (list): the affiliations filter list of tuples (institution, country)
                                 with default value set to None. 
        
    Returns: 
        None.
        
    Note:
        The globals 'COL_NAMES', 'CONCATENATED_XLSX', 'DEDUPLICATED_XLSX' and 'DIC_OUTDIR_PARSING' 
        are imported from 'BiblioSpecificGlobals' module of 'BiblioAnalysis_Utils' package.
        The function 'extend_author_institutions' is imported from 'BiblioParsingUtils' module 
        of 'BiblioAnalysis_Utils' package is used.
