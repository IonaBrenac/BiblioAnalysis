    "- articles.dat is the central file, listing all the publications within the corpus. It contains informations such as the document type (article, letter, review, conf proceeding, etc), title, year of publication, publication source, doi, number of citations (given by WOS or Scopus at the time of the extraction) AND a unique identifier used in all the other files to identify a precise publication.\n",
    "- database.dat keeps track of the origin of the data, some part of the analysis being specific to WOS or Scopus data.\n",
    "- authors.dat lists all authors names associated to all publications ID.\n",
    "- addresses.dat lists all adresses associated to all publications ID, along with a specific ID for each adresse line. These adresses are reported as they appear in the raw data, without any further processing.\n",
    "- countries.dat lists all countries associated to all publications ID and adresses lines ID. The countries are extracted from the adresses fields of the raw data, with some cleaning (changing mentions of US states and UK countries to respectively the USA and UK).\n",
    "- institutions.dat lists all the comma-separated entities appearing in the adresses field associated to all publications ID and adresses lines ID, except those refering to a physical adresses. These entities correspond to various name variants of universities, organisms, hospitals, labs, services, departments, etc as they appear in the raw data. No treatment is made to e.g. filtering out the entities corresponding a given hierarchy level.\n",
    "- keywords.dat lists various types of keywords associated to all publications ID. \"AK\" keywords correspond to Author's keywords. \"IK\" keywords correspond to either WOS or Scopus keywords, which are built based on the authors' keywords, the title and abstract. \"TK\" correspond to title words (from which we simply remove common words and stop words - no stemming is performed). TK are especially useful when studying pre-90's publications, when the use of keywords was not yet standard.\n",
    "- references.dat lists all the references associated to all publications ID. The rawdata is parsed to store the first author name, title, source, volume and page of each reference of the raw \"references\" field.\n",
    "- subjects.dat lists all subject categories associated to all publications ID (a journal may be associated to many subject category). WOS classifies the sources it indexes into ∼ 250 categories, that are reported in the extracted data. Scopus classifies its sources into 27 major categories and ∼ 300 sub-categories, none of which are reported in the extracted data. We use Elsevier Source Title List (october 2017 version) to retrieve that information. The \"subject.dat\" contains the info relative to the major categories.\n",
    "- subjects2.dat lists Scopus's sub-categories, if the use database is Scopus.\n",
    "- AA_log.txt keeps track of the date/time the script was executed and of all the messages displayed on the terminal (number of publications extracted, % of references rejected, etc)."

    "- it performs a series of generic statistical analysis, storing the numbers of distinct items of each type (e.g. there are x distinct keyword in the corpus ), the distributions of number of occurrences of each item (e.g. there are x keywords appearing in at least y publications) and the distribution of number of items per publication (e.g.there are x% of publications with y keywords). All these statistics are stored in the \"DISTRIBS_itemuse.json\" file.\n",
    "- it also performs a co-occurrence analysis, computing the number of co-occurrence of pairs of items among the top 100 most frequent items of each type (e.g. computing how often the two most used keywords appear together in the same publications). The results of this analysis are stored in the \"coocnetworks.json\" file. More systematic co-occurrence analysis can also be performed with another script, cf the Co-occurrence Maps section below.\n",
    "All the generated files can be opened and read with a simple text editor. The freq_xxx.dat, listing items by order of frequency, can also be read in a spreadsheet software such as excel. All the files are however primarily made to be read in the BiblioMaps interface."

    "- It first creates the BC network, computing Kessler similarities between each pair of publications\n",
    "- It detects a first set of clusters (which we will refer to as \"TOP\") using Thomas Aynaud's python implementation of the louvain algorithm. A second set of clusters (\"SUBTOP\") is then computed by applying the same algorithm to the publications in each TOP cluster, hence providing a 2-level hierarchical partition.\n",
    "- The script will then asked whether you want to create output files for the cluster. By default, the script will output information only for clusters with more than 50 publications, but the script will asked you to confirm / change this threshold. Several files will then be created by the script:\n",
    "    - Output 1: two json files, storing information about the clusters, to be used in the BiblioMaps interface (cf below).\n",
    "    - Output 2a: two .tex files (one for each hierarchical level) you'll have to compile, displaying an \"ID Card\" for each cluster, ie the list of the most frequent keywords, subject, authors, references, etc... used by the publications within this cluster.\n",
    "    - Output 2b: one .gdf file storing information relative to the BC clusters at both the TOP and SUBTOP level. You may open this file with Gephi. You may create visualisations of either the TOP or SUBTOP level by filtering it out, resie the nodes with the \"size\" parameter, run a spatialisation layout algorithm (Force Atlas 2 usually yield satisfaying layouts). You may also choose a label within the few that are available (e.g. 'most_frequent_k' correspond to the most frequent keywords of each cluster). Refer to the Id cards created with latex to know more about the content of each cluster.\n",
    "- Finally, the script proposes you to output the BC network at the publication level, in both a gdf output format that can be opened with Gephi and a json format that can be opened in the BiblioMaps interface. You may either keep the whole network or select only the publications within a given cluster. Keep in mind that both interfaces can only handle a given number of nodes (no more than a few thousands for Gephi, a few hundreds for BiblioMaps)."
